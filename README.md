# Line Follower Robot  

This project demonstrates how to build a Line Follower Robot using Arduino Nano, L298N Motor Driver, and a 5-Channel IR Sensor Array. The robot autonomously follows a line based on contrasting colors (e.g., a black line on a white surface).

## Components  
### Hardware  
1. **Arduino Nano**  
   - The microcontroller processes sensor input and controls the motors.  
2. **L298N Motor Driver**  
   - Drives the two DC motors by controlling their speed and direction.  
3. **5-Channel IR Sensor Array (HW 871)**  
   - Detects the line's position on the surface.  
4. **BO Motors (2)**  
   - Provide motion to the robot's wheels.  
5. **7.4V Battery**  
   - Powers the entire circuit, including motors and sensors.  
6. **Wheels (2)**  
   - Attached to the BO motors to enable movement.  
7. **Chassis**  
   - A base to mount all the components.  
8. **Jumper Wires**  
   - Used to connect components.

### Software  
- **Arduino IDE**  
  - To write and upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

## Working  

1. **IR Sensor Array**  
   - The 5-channel IR sensor detects the surface color beneath it.  
   - Each sensor outputs HIGH (1) on detecting a white surface and LOW (0) for a black surface (or vice versa).  

2. **Microcontroller (Arduino Nano)**  
   - The Arduino Nano reads the sensor array data to determine the position of the line relative to the robot.  
   - Based on the lineâ€™s position, the Arduino calculates appropriate motor speed and direction using predefined logic.

3. **Motor Driver (L298N)**  
   - The Arduino sends control signals to the motor driver.  
   - The motor driver adjusts the speed and rotation of the motors to align the robot along the line.  

4. **Robot Movement**  
   - If the line is centered, both motors rotate at the same speed, and the robot moves forward.  
   - If the line deviates, one motor slows down while the other speeds up to steer the robot back onto the line.

This system ensures that the robot continuously tracks and follows the designated line.
